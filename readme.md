This is a list of awesome things to come out of Haystack Labs. It could be recommended 3D scanning software, the best digital knitting software, or the best pen ever. 

## Design Tools 
### Textiles 
- [Knitscape](https://knitscape.net/). Open-source digital knitting software developed by Hannah Twigg-Smith. Machine Agency, Human Centered Design and Engineering, University of Washington. 
### Vector 
- [Shadowify](https://leomcelroy.com/shadowify/). Image to layer generation tool. Used for lasercuting stacked paper shadow artworks. Developed by Leo McElroy during Haystack Labs 2024. 
- [SVG-to-Prusa](https://leomcelroy.com/svg-to-prusa/). Image to GCode for Prusa. Used for developing simple one-layer toolpaths on the Prusa 3D printer. Developed by Leo McElroy during Haystack Labs 2024. 

## 3D Scanning 
- **Luma** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/luma-ai/id1615849914), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.lumalabs.polar&hl=en_US)). A NeRF based 3D scanner that can capture objects or scenes. Outputs to a variety of 3D model formats including glb. Can work on older hardware and works reasonably well on shiny and translucent things. Hereâ€™s a scan of a [stereoscope from 1860](https://lumalabs.ai/capture/97FFB41C-CF9F-47E4-BF17-554221BF4B04).

- **Scaniverse** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scaniverse-3d-scanner/id1541433223), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticlabs.scaniverse)). LiDAR & photogrammetry based 3D scanner, best at capturing medium sized objects, fast at capturing scenes with LiDAR. Photogrammetry mode is pretty reliable for creating printable objects.

- **Polycam** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polycam-3d-scanner-lidar-360/id1532482376), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.polycam&hl=en_US)). Photogrammetry & LiDAR based 3D scanner, has Vision Pro app

### 2D-to-3D
- **[Meshy](https://www.meshy.a/)**. A text or image-to-3D model service.
- **[CSM](https://www.csm.ai/)**. A text or image-to-3D and auto animation service. Local to Cambridge!
